{-
    Using the carmichael numbers you can see that the fermat
    checks fails a lot.

    Fermat's little theorem states that if p is a prime number,
    then for any integer b, the number b p âˆ’ b is an integer 
    multiple of p. Carmichael numbers are composite numbers 
    which have this property. Carmichael numbers are also 
    called Fermat pseudoprimes or absolute Fermat pseudoprimes. 
    A Carmichael number will pass a Fermat primality test to 
    every base b relatively prime to the number, even though it 
    is not actually prime.
